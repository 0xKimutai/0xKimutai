  <p align="center" style="color:#C0FFFF; max-width: 800px; margin: auto; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    I'm <b>Kevin Kimutai</b>, known online as <code style="color:#00FFFF;">ghost_commit</code> â€” a passionate <b>Web3 developer</b> and <b>fullstack engineer</b> with a strong foundation in <b>Python, JavaScript/TypeScript</b>, and <b>Solidity</b>. I build smart contracts, scalable backend APIs with <b>FastAPI</b> and <b>Django REST</b>, and robust frontend apps using <b>React</b> and <b>Next.js</b>. <br/><br/>
    
    I'm deeply invested in crafting clean, secure, and production-ready systems, whether it's building DeFi tools, AI-enhanced web apps, or automating trading workflows. My curiosity drives me to blend technologies â€” from <b>smart contracts</b> to <b>AI/ML models</b> â€” always optimizing for impact, speed, and elegance. <br/><br/>

    Iâ€™ve been coding since 2022, and Iâ€™m currently sharpening my backend and blockchain engineering skills while building real-world tools and contributing to open-source projects. You'll usually find me deep in code, running experiments, or creating bots that turn ideas into working systems.
